# ThreeTieredExample

Classic three tiered software architecture in just three files.  This was intended as a MEAN stack example (MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs, NodeJs) except there isn't a real database there just a file containing some JSON.

For demo purposes the three layers can be collapsed down into just a web front-end (but of course the "database" will reset every time the page reloads)
